# Beer-Tracker-5000
Code Louisville .Net/C3 Project

The Beer Tracker 5000 was built as a way to help prevent people from drinking the same bad beer twice. Because sometimes you don't remember. It's built using ASP.Net and runs in Visual Studio. No issues were found running with de-bugging or without. Thanks for checking out my project.
